                			  	   I started at Double First, in Oct 2010, assisting with installations during a major upgrade initiative.<br>
                			  	   Between installations and answering support queries, i was writing Reports using Stimulsoft.Net and supporting Reports written in Crystal Reports.<br>
                			  	   With the ever increasing complexity of customer requirements, more and more coding was written into the reports to enable them to function within the clients expectations.<br>
                			  	   The report writing soon became my primary responsibility with spare time being spent on short-term software projects such as Data Migrations and in-house tools.<br>
                			  	   With the experience gained, in November 2014, i was offered a full time position within the Development team, fixing bugs and working on short-term tasks on both Engage and the Portal.
